To achieve both **confidentiality** and **authentication** using a combination of RSA and AES, we can design a hybrid cryptographic scheme. Below is a detailed outline of the mechanism and demonstration:

---

## **Design of the Secure Mechanism**

### **1. Key Exchange with RSA (for Confidentiality)**
- RSA will be used to securely exchange an AES session key between two users (User A and User B).
- RSA ensures confidentiality of the key exchange since only the intended recipient can decrypt the session key using their private key.

### **2. AES for Encryption (Confidentiality)**
- Once the AES session key is exchanged, AES will be used for encrypting the actual messages.
- The scheme will:
  - Support **key sizes** of 192 or 256 bits.
  - Use a **block size** of 128 bits.
  - Allow a **customizable number of rounds** (12 for 192-bit keys, 14 for 256-bit keys).

### **3. Digital Signature for Authentication**
- To authenticate a message, the sender will sign it using their RSA private key.
- The receiver will verify the signature using the sender's RSA public key.

---

## **Steps for Confidentiality (Secure Communication)**

### **Key Exchange Process**
1. **Key Generation**:
   - Both users generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys).
2. **Session Key Generation**:
   - User A generates a random AES session key (192 or 256 bits).
3. **Key Encryption**:
   - User A encrypts the AES session key using User B's RSA public key.
4. **Key Transmission**:
   - User A sends the encrypted session key to User B.
5. **Key Decryption**:
   - User B decrypts the session key using their RSA private key.

### **Message Encryption and Transmission**
1. User A encrypts the plaintext message using AES with the session key.
2. User A sends the ciphertext to User B.
3. User B decrypts the ciphertext using AES with the shared session key.

---

## **Steps for Authentication**

### **Message Signing**
1. User A computes a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the plaintext message.
2. User A encrypts the hash using their RSA private key to create a digital signature.
3. User A sends the message and the digital signature to User B.

### **Message Verification**
1. User B decrypts the digital signature using User A's RSA public key to retrieve the hash.
2. User B computes the hash of the received message using the same hashing algorithm.
3. User B compares the decrypted hash with the computed hash. If they match, the message is authenticated.

## **Demonstration of Confidentiality and Authentication**

### **Confidentiality Demonstration**
1. **Scenario**:
   - User A wants to send a confidential message to User B.
2. **Steps**:
   - User A generates an AES session key and encrypts it using User B's RSA public key.
   - User B decrypts the session key using their RSA private key.
   - User A encrypts the message using AES with the session key and sends it to User B.
   - User B decrypts the message using the same AES session key.

### **Authentication Demonstration**
1. **Scenario**:
   - User A wants to ensure that User B can verify the authenticity of a message.
2. **Steps**:
   - User A hashes the message and signs the hash using their RSA private key.
   - User A sends the message and signature to User B.
   - User B verifies the signature using User A's RSA public key.

## **Efficient and Secure Implementation**
- **RSA Key Sizes**: Use a minimum of 2048 bits for RSA keys to ensure strong security.
- **AES Modes**: Use AES in **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** for authenticated encryption, combining confidentiality and integrity.
- **Hash Function**: Use a secure hash function like **SHA-256** for generating message digests.
- **Randomness**: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for generating AES keys and RSA key pairs.

Would you like me to provide a code implementation for this scheme?

The code demonstrates both confidentiality and authentication:

1. **Confidentiality**: 
   - An AES session key is securely exchanged using RSA encryption.
   - The message is encrypted using AES and decrypted on the receiver's side.

2. **Authentication**:
   - A digital signature is generated by hashing the message and signing it with the sender's RSA private key.
   - The receiver verifies the signature using the sender's RSA public key.

You can run this Python code using the `pycryptodome` library. Let me know if you need further assistance!

The current code demonstrates how two users (User A and User B) can achieve **confidentiality** by securely exchanging an AES session key using RSA and then encrypting and decrypting a message using AES. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process demonstrated in the code:

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Both users generate their RSA key pairs (`public_key_a`, `private_key_a` for User A and `public_key_b`, `private_key_b` for User B).

2. **AES Key Generation**:
   - User A generates a random AES session key (`aes_key`) with a customizable size (192-bit or 256-bit).

3. **Key Exchange**:
   - User A encrypts the AES session key using User B's RSA public key (`public_key_b`) and sends the encrypted key (`encrypted_aes_key`) to User B.
   - User B decrypts the AES session key using their RSA private key (`private_key_b`).

4. **Message Encryption**:
   - User A encrypts a confidential message (`message`) using AES in GCM mode with the session key.
   - The encrypted message (`ciphertext`) and associated authentication tag (`tag`) are sent to User B.

5. **Message Decryption**:
   - User B decrypts the message using AES in GCM mode with the session key and verifies its integrity using the tag.

---

### **Output of the Demonstration**

- **Confidentiality**:
  - The original message and the decrypted message are displayed, confirming that User B successfully decrypted the message.
  
- **Authentication**:
  - Although not required for confidentiality, the code also demonstrates how User A signs the message with their RSA private key and how User B verifies the signature.

---

### **Running the Code**

You can run this Python script to see the secure communication in action. If you'd like, I can modify or enhance the demonstration further to focus on additional scenarios or to provide detailed logs for each step. Let me know!

To demonstrate that a user can have their message authenticated by another user, the following steps are already implemented in the code:

---

### **Steps for Authentication**

1. **Message Signing by User A**:
   - User A creates a hash of the message using SHA-256.
   - User A signs the hash using their RSA private key (`private_key_a`).
   - The signature is sent along with the message to User B.

2. **Signature Verification by User B**:
   - User B receives the message and the signature.
   - User B creates a hash of the received message using SHA-256.
   - User B verifies the signature using User A's RSA public key (`public_key_a`).
   - If the verification succeeds, the message is authenticated as being sent by User A and not tampered with.

---

### **Output of the Code**

The output includes:
- The original and decrypted message (from the confidentiality demonstration).
- A verification result stating whether the signature is valid.

---

### **Modifications for Clarity**
If you'd like, I can add explicit output or logs for each step of the authentication process to make it clearer. Let me know!

To achieve the best security and efficiency for both confidentiality and authentication, we can make some optimizations and improvements to the existing implementation:

---

### **Confidentiality Enhancements**
1. **AES Key Derivation**:
   - Instead of directly generating a random AES key, use a secure key derivation function (KDF) such as PBKDF2 or HKDF. This approach adds an extra layer of security by deriving keys from shared secrets or random seeds.
   
2. **RSA Key Size**:
   - Increase the RSA key size to 3072 or 4096 bits to future-proof against advances in computational power.

3. **Hybrid Encryption Optimization**:
   - Use RSA only to encrypt a randomly generated seed, and derive the AES key from this seed using a KDF. This reduces the size of the RSA-encrypted payload and increases efficiency.

---

### **Authentication Enhancements**
1. **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**:
   - While RSA signatures are secure, combining them with an AES-based MAC (e.g., HMAC-SHA256) ensures integrity and authenticity at the message level, even if RSA verification is not used.

2. **Separate Signing and Encryption Keys**:
   - Use distinct RSA key pairs for signing and encryption to follow best practices for key management.

### **Key Improvements**
1. **HKDF for AES Key Derivation**:
   - Provides a cryptographically secure and reusable method for key generation.

2. **Enhanced RSA Key Size**:
   - Increases resistance against brute-force attacks.

3. **HMAC for Integrity**:
   - Adds an additional layer of message authentication.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Separate keys for encryption and authentication ensure better key management.

This revised implementation ensures high security and efficiency while adhering to best practices for both confidentiality and authentication. Let me know if you need further clarifications!

To modify the AES encryption mode to **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**, we need to make the following changes in the current code:

1. **Switch AES Mode**:
   - Replace `AES.MODE_GCM` with `AES.MODE_CBC`.

2. **Initialization Vector (IV)**:
   - CBC mode requires an Initialization Vector (IV) for encryption. The IV must be the same during decryption.

3. **Padding**:
   - CBC mode requires the plaintext to be a multiple of the block size (16 bytes for AES). We will use PKCS7 padding to ensure this.

Below is the modified code with AES in CBC mode:

### **Modified Code for AES with CBC**

### **Explanation of Changes**
1. **Padding**:
   - Used `Crypto.Util.Padding.pad` to pad the plaintext before encryption.
   - Used `Crypto.Util.Padding.unpad` to remove padding after decryption.

2. **Initialization Vector (IV)**:
   - A random IV is generated for each encryption and shared with the recipient.

3. **AES in CBC Mode**:
   - Changed the mode to `AES.MODE_CBC`.
